/**
 * Edge Stub — Dead Code Satisfier for V8 Isolate Bundles
 *
 * INTERNAL: Lives in dist/ but NOT in package.json exports.
 * Only used by CLI deploy esbuild aliases.
 *
 * Provides class shells that satisfy the AST so esbuild
 * can compile @modelcontextprotocol/sdk without errors.
 * These classes are NEVER instantiated at runtime because
 * startServer() intercepts before any transport is created.
 *
 * Two tiers:
 *   Tier 1 — Structural stubs (safe for AST, never called at runtime)
 *   Tier 2 — Executable stubs (CRASH immediately if invoked at runtime)
 *
 * @internal
 * @module
