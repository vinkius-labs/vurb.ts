    description: 'A TypeScript framework with a Structured Perception Layer for AI agents. MVA (Model-View-Agent) architecture with Presenters, cognitive guardrails, and structured perception packages.',
    faqs: [
      { q: 'What is Vurb.ts?', a: 'Vurb.ts is a TypeScript framework for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that introduces the MVA (Model-View-Agent) architectural pattern. It replaces raw JSON responses with structured perception packages — validated data, domain rules, server-rendered charts, and explicit action affordances — so AI agents perceive and act on data deterministically instead of guessing.' },
      { q: 'What is MVA (Model-View-Agent)?', a: 'MVA is a new architectural pattern created by Renato Marinho at Vinkius Labs. It replaces MVC\'s human-centric View with a Presenter — an agent-centric perception layer. The Model validates with Zod, the Presenter adds domain rules, UI blocks, affordances, and guardrails, and the Agent (LLM) consumes structured output to act deterministically.' },
      { q: 'How is Vurb.ts different from the official MCP SDK?', a: 'The official MCP SDK (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk) provides the protocol transport layer — stdin/stdio, HTTP. Vurb.ts builds on top and adds: MVA architecture with Presenters, action consolidation (5,000+ ops behind one tool), Zod validation with .strip(), tRPC-style middleware, self-healing errors, server-rendered UI blocks (ECharts, Mermaid), cognitive guardrails, state sync with cache signals, TOON encoding for 40% fewer tokens, and a type-safe tRPC-style client.' },
      { q: 'Is Vurb.ts free and open source?', a: 'Yes. Vurb.ts is open source under the Apache 2.0 license. It is free to use in personal and commercial projects. Built and maintained by Vinkius Labs.' },
      { q: 'What is action consolidation in Vurb.ts?', a: 'Action consolidation lets you group 5,000+ operations behind a single MCP tool using a discriminator enum. Instead of 50 separate tools flooding the LLM prompt, the agent sees ONE tool with actions like users.list, billing.refund. This reduces token usage by 10x and eliminates tool-selection hallucination.' },
      { q: 'What are cognitive guardrails in Vurb.ts?', a: 'Cognitive guardrails (.agentLimit()) prevent large datasets from overwhelming the AI context window. When a query returns 10,000 rows, the guardrail automatically truncates to a safe limit (e.g., 50 items) and injects guidance like "Showing 50 of 10,000. Use filters to narrow results." This prevents context DDoS and reduces costs by up to 100x.' },
      { q: 'Does Vurb.ts work with Claude, GPT, and other LLMs?', a: 'Yes. Vurb.ts is LLM-agnostic. It follows the Model Context Protocol standard, supported by Claude, GPT-5.2, Gemini, and any MCP-compatible client. Structured perception packages work with any LLM that processes text.' },
      { q: 'What languages and runtimes does Vurb.ts support?', a: 'Vurb.ts is written in TypeScript and runs on Node.js >= 18. It requires TypeScript >= 5.7 for full type inference. All APIs are fully typed with generics, providing autocomplete and compile-time safety.' },

    faqs: [
      { q: 'What is the MVA (Model-View-Agent) pattern?', a: 'MVA is an architectural pattern that replaces MVC for AI-native applications. Instead of a human-centric View, MVA uses a Presenter — a deterministic perception layer that structures responses for AI agents with validated data, domain rules, UI blocks, suggested actions, and cognitive guardrails. It was created by Renato Marinho at Vinkius Labs.' },
      { q: 'How does MVA differ from MVC?', a: 'MVC was designed for human users interacting via browsers. MVA replaces the View with the Presenter — designed for AI agents. While MVC Views render HTML/CSS, MVA Presenters render structured perception packages: Zod-validated data, system rules, ECharts/Mermaid visualizations, HATEOAS affordances, and context guardrails.' },
      { q: 'Who created MVA?', a: 'MVA (Model-View-Agent) was created by Renato Marinho at Vinkius Labs as a purpose-built architecture for AI agents operating over the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It is the core pattern behind the Vurb.ts framework.' },
      { q: 'Why is MVA needed for AI agents?', a: 'AI agents cannot interpret raw JSON the way humans read UI. They need explicit domain context ("amount_cents is in cents"), explicit next-action hints (what tools to call next), and cognitive guardrails (limits on data volume). MVA provides all of this through the Presenter layer, eliminating guesswork and hallucination.' },
      { q: 'What is a structured perception package?', a: 'A structured perception package is the output of an MVA Presenter. It contains: (1) Zod-validated and stripped data, (2) system rules with domain context, (3) server-rendered UI blocks (charts, diagrams), (4) suggested next actions with reasons, and (5) cognitive guardrails. This replaces raw JSON.stringify() output.' },
      { q: 'What is the role of the Presenter in MVA?', a: 'The Presenter is the View layer in MVA. It sits between the Model (raw data) and the Agent (LLM). It transforms raw data into a structured perception package by: validating with a schema, injecting system rules, rendering UI blocks, suggesting next actions based on data state, and enforcing agent limits. It is defined once and reused across all tools that return that entity.' },
      { q: 'How does MVA prevent AI hallucination?', a: 'MVA prevents hallucination through four deterministic mechanisms: (1) Zod .strip() silently removes parameters the AI invents. (2) System rules provide domain context so the AI interprets data correctly. (3) .suggestActions() tells the AI exactly what tools to call next. (4) .agentLimit() prevents context overflow that degrades accuracy.' },

    faqs: [
      { q: 'What problems does MVA solve that raw MCP doesn\'t?', a: 'Raw MCP servers dump JSON.stringify() output, have no domain context, no action hints, leak internal fields, and force switch/case routing. MVA solves all of this with structured perception packages, system rules, Agentic HATEOAS, Zod .strip() security, and discriminator-based action consolidation. It is the definitive strategy for secure Legacy API Migration.' },
      { q: 'How does action consolidation reduce token usage?', a: 'Instead of registering 50 individual tools (each with name + description + schema in the prompt consuming ~100 tokens), Vurb.ts consolidates them behind ONE tool with a discriminator enum. The LLM sees a single tool definition instead of 50, reducing prompt token usage by up to 10x.' },
      { q: 'How do cognitive guardrails prevent context DDoS?', a: 'When a query returns 10,000 rows, .agentLimit(50) truncates to 50 items and injects guidance: "Showing 50 of 10,000. Use filters to narrow results." This prevents context overflow, reduces costs from ~$2.40 to ~$0.02 per call, and maintains AI accuracy.' },
      { q: 'What are self-healing errors in Vurb.ts?', a: 'toolError() returns structured recovery hints instead of plain error strings. Example: { code: "NOT_FOUND", recovery: { action: "list", suggestion: "List invoices to find the correct ID" }, suggestedArgs: { status: "pending" } }. The AI automatically retries with corrected parameters instead of giving up.' },
      { q: 'How does Vurb.ts improve security over raw MCP?', a: 'Raw MCP servers leak all database fields to the LLM, including internal data like password_hash and SSN. Vurb.ts uses Zod .strip() as a security boundary — only fields declared in the Presenter schema reach the AI. Undeclared fields are silently removed.' },
      { q: 'What is Agentic HATEOAS?', a: 'Agentic HATEOAS is the concept of providing explicit next-action hints to AI agents based on data state, inspired by REST HATEOAS. Using .suggestActions(), each response includes tools the agent can call next with reasons. Example: invoice status "pending" suggests { tool: "billing.pay", reason: "Process payment" }.' },
      { q: 'How does TOON encoding save tokens?', a: 'TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) is a compact serialization format in Vurb.ts that reduces token count by ~40% compared to standard JSON.

    title: 'Cost Reduction & Anti-Hallucination — Design Principles',
    description: 'How Vurb.ts reduces LLM API costs and prevents hallucination through fewer tokens, fewer requests, action consolidation, TOON encoding, cognitive guardrails, and self-healing errors.',
    faqs: [
      { q: 'How does Vurb.ts reduce LLM API costs?', a: 'Vurb.ts targets cost reduction through eight mechanisms: action consolidation (fewer tools in the prompt), TOON encoding (~30-50% fewer tokens), cognitive guardrails (bounded response sizes), JIT context (no wasted tokens on irrelevant rules), Zod .strip() (fewer hallucinated-parameter retries), self-healing errors (fewer correction attempts), agentic affordances (fewer wrong-tool selections), and State Sync (fewer stale-data re-reads).' },
      { q: 'What is the relationship between tokens and hallucination?', a: 'Cost and hallucination share a root cause: too many tokens flowing through the context window and too many requests because the agent did not get what it needed the first time. Reducing prompt noise improves accuracy, and better accuracy reduces retries — creating a virtuous cycle of lower cost and better behavior.' },
      { q: 'What is action consolidation in Vurb.ts?', a: 'Action consolidation groups multiple operations behind a single MCP tool using a discriminator enum. Instead of 50 separate tools flooding the prompt with ~10,000 schema tokens, a grouped tool uses ~1,500 tokens. This reduces the token budget consumed by tool definitions and helps the agent select the correct action.' },
      { q: 'What is TOON encoding?', a: 'TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) is a compact serialization format that replaces verbose JSON with pipe-delimited tabular data. It achieves roughly 30-50% token reduction over equivalent JSON for tabular data, reducing both prompt and response token costs. Available via toonSuccess() for responses and toonMode for descriptions.' },
      { q: 'How do cognitive guardrails reduce costs?', a: 'The Presenter .agentLimit() method truncates large result sets before they reach the LLM. A query returning 10,000 rows (~5 million tokens, ~$8.75 at GPT-5.2 pricing) is truncated to 50 rows (~25,000 tokens, ~$0.04). The truncation includes guidance for the agent to use filters, teaching it to narrow results instead of requesting everything.' },
      { q: 'What are self-healing errors and how do they reduce retries?', a: 'Self-healing errors translate raw validation failures into directive correction prompts. Instead of "Validation failed: email: Invalid", the agent receives: "Expected: a valid email address (e.g. user@example.com). You sent: admin@local." This aims to help the agent self-correct on the first retry rather than guessing blindly across multiple attempts.' },
      { q: 'How does State Sync prevent unnecessary LLM requests?', a: 'State Sync injects causal invalidation signals after mutations (e.g., "[System: Cache invalidated for sprints.* — caused by sprints.update]") and cache-control directives in tool descriptions (e.g., "[Cache-Control: immutable]"). This helps the agent know when to re-read data and when cached results are still valid, avoiding unnecessary API calls.' },

      { q: 'Can I use Vurb.ts with existing MCP servers?', a: 'Yes. Vurb.ts uses the standard MCP SDK under the hood. You can incrementally adopt it by converting tools one at a time. Existing raw handlers continue to work alongside Vurb.ts tools on the same server.' },
      { q: 'Does Vurb.ts work with Claude, GPT, and other LLMs?', a: 'Yes. Vurb.ts is LLM-agnostic. It follows the Model Context Protocol standard, which is supported by Claude, GPT-5.2, Gemini, and any MCP-compatible client. The structured responses work with any LLM that can process text.' },
      { q: 'What makes Vurb.ts better than writing raw MCP handlers?', a: 'Raw handlers require manual switch/case routing, manual JSON.stringify, no validation, no domain context, and no security boundary.

      { q: 'What is the learning curve for Vurb.ts?', a: 'If you know TypeScript and basic MCP concepts, you can be productive in under 30 minutes. defineTool() requires zero Zod knowledge. createTool() requires basic Zod. Presenters are optional and can be added incrementally after your tools work.' },
      { q: 'Does Vurb.ts work with Vercel AI SDK or LangChain?', a: 'Yes. Vurb.ts is the perfect backend Server.

      { q: 'What are Runtime Guards in Vurb.ts?', a: 'Runtime Guards are two built-in safety mechanisms: (1) the Concurrency Guard (Bulkhead pattern) limits simultaneous tool executions using a semaphore with backpressure queue, and (2) the Egress Guard truncates oversized response payloads at the byte level. Both have zero overhead when not configured — no guard objects are created.' },
      { q: 'How does the Concurrency Guard prevent thundering herd?', a: 'The Concurrency Guard implements a per-tool semaphore with configurable maxActive slots and maxQueue capacity. When the LLM fires 50 concurrent calls, only maxActive execute simultaneously. Excess calls are either queued (up to maxQueue) or immediately rejected with a SERVER_BUSY error — preventing downstream API rate limiting and cascade failures.' },
      { q: 'What happens when a tool is at capacity?', a: 'When all active slots and queue positions are full, the tool returns a structured toolError with code SERVER_BUSY. The error includes a recovery suggestion telling the LLM to reduce concurrent calls and retry sequentially. This self-healing error causes the LLM to naturally slow down its cadence — no manual intervention needed.' },
      { q: 'How does the Egress Guard prevent OOM crashes?', a: 'The Egress Guard measures the total UTF-8 byte length of all content blocks in a ToolResponse. If it exceeds maxPayloadBytes, the text is truncated at a safe character boundary and a system intervention message is injected: \"You MUST use pagination (limit/offset) or filters.\" This prevents Node.js OOM crashes from serializing large payloads and protects against LLM context window overflow.' },
      { q: 'Does Vurb.ts comply with the MCP rate limiting requirement?', a: 'Yes. The MCP specification requires servers to rate limit tool invocations. The .concurrency() method on the builder fulfills this requirement at the framework level. Without it, developers must implement rate limiting manually per tool — which is error-prone and inconsistent.' },
      { q: 'How do Runtime Guards work with AbortSignal?', a: 'The Concurrency Guard cooperates with AbortSignal for queued waiters. If a user cancels while a call is waiting in the backpressure queue, the waiter is immediately rejected without ever executing handler code. Active executions use the existing Cancellation pipeline. The concurrency slot is always released via try/finally — no leaks.' },
      { q: 'How do I test Runtime Guards?', a: 'For concurrency: fire multiple tool.execute() calls simultaneously and assert the Nth call returns SERVER_BUSY. For egress: return a large payload (e.g., 10,000 characters) with maxPayloadBytes set low (2048) and verify the response contains SYSTEM INTERVENTION. Both guards work with direct builder.execute() — no server mock needed.' },
      { q: 'What is the Intent Mutex?', a: 'The Intent Mutex is an automatic anti-race condition guard.

It activates automatically on any action marked with destructive: true.' },

      { q: "Why do we need a new architecture for AI agents?", a: "Because AI agents do not perceive data like humans. If you dump a raw database row (MVC Model) directly to an LLM, it gets confused by UUIDs and foreign keys. MVA structures the data optimally for the Agent's context window." },
      { q: "What is the role of the Presenter in MVA?", a: "The Presenter is the translation layer. It takes raw Model data and converts it into a 'Perception Package'—stripping PII, applying token limits, injecting system rules, and adding UI blocks for human oversight." },
      { q: "How does MVA reduce AI hallucinations?", a: "By delivering deterministic, highly structured context. When the AI receives exactly the data it needs, bounded by explicit business rules injected by the Presenter, it stops guessing and starts executing reliably." },

      { q: "What are the core axioms of MVA?", a: "1. Agents are deterministic function callers. 2. Raw data causes context collapse. 3. System rules must be spatially adjacent to the data they govern. 4. Next-action hints (Affordances) prevent temporal hallucination." },
      { q: "What is 'Spatial Adjacency' in prompt engineering?", a: "LLMs pay the most attention to instructions that are physically close to the data they relate to in the combined prompt. MVA Presenters inject system rules directly inline with the returned data payload, maximizing strict compliance." },
      { q: "How does MVA handle 'Context Collapse'?", a: "When an LLM is fed 50,000 tokens of raw JSON, its attention mechanism degrades, and it hallucinates details. MVA prevents this via 'Cognitive Guardrails' which forcefully truncate payloads to safe token limits before they reach the Agent." },
      { q: "What is 'Temporal Hallucination'?", a: "When an agent executes an action too early (e.g., trying to 'refund' before checking 'payment_status'). MVA fixes this using 'Agentic Affordances', which explicitly tell the agent what valid actions it can take based on the current data state." },
      { q: "Why must UI and Agent perception be unified?", a: "If the AI sees different data than the human user observing the chat UI, the human cannot trust or verify the AI's reasoning.

      { q: "Why can't I just use my MVC Controllers for my AI Agent?", a: "MVC Controllers usually return vast, deeply nested JSON graph payloads designed for React frontends to parse visually. If you feed that raw graph to an LLM, you burn massive token costs and cause severe hallucination." },
      { q: "Does MVA replace my primary MVC application?", a: "No, they are complementary. Your primary web app remains MVC. Your MCP Server, which exposes your business logic to tools like Cursor or Claude, uses MVA to safely broker that access." },

      { q: "How do Presenters handle PII (Personally Identifiable Information)?", a: "Presenters define a strict Zod schema for the output data. Unlike raw JSON responses, the Presenter explicitly drops any database column (like `password_hash` or `ssn`) that isn't explicitly defined in its Output Schema, ensuring zero data leakage." },

      { q: "Why merge data and rules into a single string?", a: "MCP Tools return text to the LLM. If rules are defined globally, the LLM often forgets or misapplies them.

      { q: "How does this relate to HATEOAS?", a: "Like HATEOAS in REST APIs (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State), where the server sends links to the next valid endpoints, Agentic Affordances dynamically route the AI through a complex state machine without needing predefined system prompts." },
      { q: "Do affordances prevent temporal hallucination?", a: "Yes. Without affordances, an AI might try to 'Refund' an order before it's paid. With affordances, the Presenter only suggests 'Refund' if `order.status === 'PAID'`, effectively locking out invalid execution paths." },
      { q: "How do I add an affordance to a Presenter?", a: "Use the `.suggestAction('action_name', 'Reason why')` method inside your Presenter. You can make it conditional: `.suggestActionIf(data.isPaid, 'refund', 'Offer a refund if requested')`." },
      { q: "Do LLMs actually follow affordance hints?", a: "Yes, overwhelmingly. LLMs are optimized to follow explicit, recent instructions. When a tool specifically says 'Next step: execute `verify_email`', the LLM naturally assumes that role and executes the function immediately." },

      { q: "Why is putting all rules in the Global System Prompt a bad idea?", a: "Large global prompts suffer from 'Lost in the Middle' syndrome—the AI forgets instructions.

      { q: "How does MVA implement Tree-Shaking technically?", a: "Tools and Presenters only inject their specific `.rule()` declarations into the payload *after* the tool executes. The LLM's context window stays pristine until the exact moment a specific domain rule becomes active." },
      { q: "Can Tree-Shaking improve AI latency?", a: "Yes. By drastically reducing the size of the conversation history payload (because thousands of irrelevant rules were omitted), the time-to-first-token (TTFT) when querying the LLM drops significantly." },

      { q: "Why do we need guardrails for arrays?", a: "To prevent 'Context Collapse' and OOM errors. If an AI reads too much data, its token budget instantly evaporates, and its reasoning precision plummets. MVA enforces strict limits natively in the Presenter pipeline." },
      { q: "What happens when a dataset is truncated?", a: "The Presenter truncates the data at the exact limit, and automatically appends a 'System Intervention' rule telling the AI: 'DATA WAS TRUNCATED.

    faqs: [
      { q: "What is Tool Exposition?", a: "It is the act of meticulously shaping your tool's outward appearance (name, description, Zod schema constraints) to guide the LLM's tool-selection algorithm efficiently, minimizing semantic overlap with other tools." },
      { q: "Why shouldn't I write conversational English in my tool descriptions?", a: "LLMs ignore conversational fluff. A description like 'This tool helps you fetch users' is a waste of tokens. Use dense TOON descriptions: `action: get_users | params: (id?, active?) | returns: User[]` to save space and increase precision." },
      { q: "How do `describe()` tags in Zod affect tool exposition?", a: "The LLM sees Zod `.describe()` strings perfectly integrated into the JSON Schema. You should heavily document specific constraints like `.describe('MUST be a valid ISO8601 string in UTC')` to prevent formatting errors." },
      { q: "What is Intent Collision?", a: "When two tools have similar descriptions, the AI might hallucinate and pick the wrong one randomly. Tool exposition prevents this by ensuring clear, mutually exclusive domain boundaries bounded by exact vocabulary." },
      { q: "Does the Framework UI show tool exposition annotations?", a: "Yes. Advanced clients read MCP Annotations (`title`, `priority`, `audience`). By adding `.annotations({ audience: ['assistant'] })`, you explicitly command the host orchestration client how to surface the tool visually." },

      { q: "What is an MCP Prompt?", a: "An MCP Prompt is a reusable, parameterized conversational template exposed directly by the server. Instead of users manually copy-pasting 'Create a PR' prompts into their AI chat, they just click the 'Code Review' prompt, which auto-injects the required server context." },
      { q: "How do I build prompts in Vurb.ts?", a: "Use the `promptBuilder('name')` Fluent API. You can define string arguments, apply schemas, run context middleware, and return dynamic sequences of user/assistant messages built explicitly via `new PromptResponse()`." },
      { q: "Wait, can Prompts use MVA Presenters?", a: "Yes! This is unique to Vurb.ts. Inside a prompt handler, you can fetch database rows and `.generate(data, MyPresenter)`. The prompt injects the exact same Perception Package (with system rules) as a Tool call would." },
      { q: "Are prompts evaluated synchronously?", a: "Yes, once triggered. However, prompts are uniquely powerful because they can orchestrate multiple sequential message blocks spanning documents, text, and embedded media, laying down a highly complex initial chat context in one execution." },
      { q: "Can a prompt require authentication?", a: "Absolutely. The `promptBuilder()` API natively supports `.withMiddleware()`.

      { q: "How do I generate a capability lockfile in Vurb.ts?", a: "Run `npx Vurb.ts lock` in your project root. It discovers all tools using autoDiscover, extracts their schemas, and generates an `vurb.lock.json` file. This file should be committed to version control." },
      { q: "Why should I freeze my MCP tool surface?", a: "AI capabilities change rapidly. Freezing the tool surface ensures that the exact contract (action names, parameter schemas, Presenter fields) tested in staging is the exact contract deployed to production. It prevents silent deployment of unintended capabilities." },
      { q: "What data is stored inside the lockfile?", a: "The lockfile stores a cryptographic hash of your tool routing table. It includes descriptions, TOON settings, input Zod schemas, output Presenter shapes, attached Agentic Affordances, and any destructive/idempotent markers." },
      { q: "What happens if I forget to update the lockfile?", a: "If you change a tool's TypeScript code but don't run `npx Vurb.ts lock`, the CI pipeline will fail when it runs `npx Vurb.ts check`. The automated check prevents unrecorded schema mutations from merging into the default branch." },
      { q: "Can I ignore specific tools from the lockfile?", a: "Yes. For highly dynamic tools or experimental branches, you can use `.excludeFromGovernance()` in the Toolbuilder. This prevents the tool from triggering strict CI failures when its schema inevitably changes during prototyping." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "What is the surface integrity check?", a: "It is a CI/CD process that compares your current code against the committed `vurb.lock.json`. Run `npx Vurb.ts check`. If a developer changed a schema without regenerating the lockfile, the check fails, preventing accidental contract mutations." },
      { q: "Can surface integrity checks run at server startup?", a: "Yes. You can configure ToolRegistry to perform an integrity check against the lockfile during initialization. If the schemas do not match, the server aborts startup, prioritizing safety over availability in zero-trust environments." },
      { q: "How does surface integrity prevent prompt injection attacks?", a: "By validating that the input `z.string().max(255)` schema hasn't been accidentally removed or altered by another developer. If the schema validator is removed, the lockfile hash mismatches, and the server refuses to run, protecting the backend." },
      { q: "What do I do if the integrity check fails locally?", a: "Simply review the code changes you made to the tool definitions. If the changes are intentional (e.g., adding a new parameter), run `npx Vurb.ts lock` to record the new correct state. Your subsequent `npx Vurb.ts check` will pass." },
      { q: "Does this validate the implementation logic of the handler?", a: "No. Surface integrity strictly verifies the API contract—the exposition layer that the AI agent interacts with (descriptions, schemas, metadata).

      { q: "How do I see what changed in my MCP tools?", a: "Run `npx Vurb.ts diff`. It generates a human-readable report comparing your local tool surface against the main branch lockfile. It highlights new tools, deleted actions, modified parameters, and changes to destructive/idempotent flags." },
      { q: "Can I automate contract diffing in Pull Requests?", a: "Yes. Use the Vurb.ts GitHub Action to automatically run contract diffing on PRs. It posts a comment showing exactly which AI capabilities are being added, modified, or removed, allowing security teams to audit changes easily." },
      { q: "What format does the diff output?", a: "The CLI produces a colorized terminal output by default. For CI/CD, you can pass `--format markdown` to generate a GitHub-friendly markdown table, or `--format json` to pipe the diff into an automated security rule engine." },
      { q: "Can a contract diff block a deployment?", a: "Absolutely. If you pipe the JSON output of the diff into a policy engine (like OPA or a custom script), you can configure rules such as 'Fail the pipeline if a destructive tool action is added without manager approval'." },
      { q: "Does contract diffing detect changes to Presenters?", a: "Yes. Presenters are a core part of the returned payload shape. If a developer accidentally adds a 'SSN' field into the allowed properties of the Output Presenter, the diff highlights the egress exposure immediately." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "What is zero-trust attestation for AI tools?", a: "It is a process where the generated lockfile is cryptographically signed. In production, the MCP server verifies the signature before registering tools. If the tools in memory do not match the attested lockfile, the server refuses to run them." },
      { q: "When do I need cryptographic attestation?", a: "Attestation is recommended for high-compliance environments (finance, healthcare, government) where you must mathematically prove that the AI tools running in production are exactly the ones approved during the security audit." },
      { q: "How do I sign my lockfile?", a: "You use the `fusion attest` command combined with your enterprise PKI (e.g., AWS KMS or a local private key). It calculates the SHA-256 hash of your capabilities and signs it, creating a `.sig` artifact stored alongside the lockfile." },
      { q: "What attack vector does this protect against?", a: "It protects against Supply Chain Attacks and compromised CI runners. Even if a malicious actor modifies the generated JavaScript to add a rogue 'delete_database' tool right before deployment, the server's public key verification will fail." },
      { q: "Can I use external OIDC providers for attestation?", a: "Yes. Vurb.ts's zero-trust hook allows you to verify standard JWTs or Sigstore (Fulcio) signatures. This means you can integrate it perfectly with existing modern dev-sec-ops pipelines that demand keyless signing." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "What does blast radius analysis do?", a: "It quantifies the impact of a tool change before deployment. If you modify a shared context field or a core schema, blast radius analysis shows every dependent action, Presenter, and middleware that will be affected by the change." },
      { q: "How do I calculate the blast radius of an AI tool change?", a: "Run `npx Vurb.ts analyze`. It traverses the MVA dependency graph and outputs a risk score and a list of impacted components. This helps QA teams focus testing efforts on the exact areas affected by the change." },
      { q: "What factors influence the blast radius risk score?", a: "The score increases based on three factors: how many dependencies the modified module has, whether the modified tools are marked as `destructive: true`, and whether the changes alter the external Zod validation boundaries." },
      { q: "Can blast radius checks catch recursive dependency loops?", a: "Yes. The static analyzer inherently detects circular dependencies between nested tool groups and middleware injections, failing the analysis before it triggers a stack overflow in the runtime register." },
      { q: "How is this different from contract diffing?", a: "Contract diffing shows *what* changed (e.g., 'added optional field X'). Blast radius analysis shows *who is affected* (e.g., 'this change impacts 14 distinct actions across the billing and users groups')." },

    description: 'Estimate token consumption per tool, per action, per response. Token economics helps you budget LLM costs, identify expensive tools, and optimize prompt size.',
    faqs: [
      { q: "How does Vurb.ts predict LLM token costs?", a: "The token economics engine analyzes your tool definitions, schema sizes, and Presenter payload limits. It calculates the base prompt token cost per tool and estimates response token costs based on your configured agent limits." },
      { q: "How do I optimize prompt size with token economics?", a: "Run `npx Vurb.ts tokens`. It identifies expensive tools with bloated descriptions or overly complex schemas. You can optimize them by using TOON descriptions, removing optional fields, or grouping actions to reduce the prompt surface." },
      { q: "Can token economics help me choose an LLM model?", a: "Yes. By analyzing the raw byte-size of your tool routing table, `npx Vurb.ts tokens` can recommend whether you need a massive context window (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet) or if your tools are perfectly optimized for a smaller, cheaper local model (like Llama 3)." },
      { q: "Are token estimates perfectly accurate?", a: "Estimates are roughly 90% accurate. They use the standard `tiktoken` byte-pair encoding approximations. The actual cost will depend on the proprietary tokenizers used by Anthropic or OpenAI, but the relative cost comparisons between tools are highly precise." },
      { q: "Does grouping tools reduce token cost?", a: "In most clients, yes. When a client performs nested intent discovery (Context Tree-Shaking), the LLM initially only sees the high-level group names. Thus, grouping 50 actions inside `aws` prevents the remaining 49 tools from eating tokens until the AI specifically requests the `aws` namespace." },

    title: 'Semantic Probing — AI-Powered Tool Description Audit',
    description: 'Use AI to evaluate whether your tool descriptions are clear, unambiguous, and effective. Semantic probing detects confusing descriptions before they cause hallucination.',
    faqs: [
      { q: "What is semantic probing for MCP tools?", a: "It is an automated audit that uses an LLM to evaluate your tool descriptions. It tests if the descriptions are clear, unambiguous, and effectively guide an AI agent. This catches confusing prompts before they cause hallucination in production." },
      { q: "How does Semantic Probing detect ambiguity?", a: "The probe engine passes your tool schema and description to an evaluator LLM (acting as the 'judge'). It asks the judge: 'Would you know exactly how to format the arguments for this tool based solely on this description?' If the judge requires clarification, the probe flags the description as low-quality." },
      { q: "Does running semantic probes cost money?", a: "Yes, because it requires making real API calls to an LLM evaluator backend (like an OpenAI or Anthropic API key). For this reason, semantic probing is typically run locally or occasionally in CI, rather than continuously." },
      { q: "What is a 'TOON description' and how does it relate to probing?", a: "Semantic Probes often suggest rewriting bloated descriptions into 'TOON Descriptions' (Token-Optimized Object Notation). These are ultra-dense, semi-structured shorthand descriptions that LLMs understand perfectly but consume far fewer tokens than conversational English." },
      { q: "Can I use semantic probing to detect overlapping tools?", a: "Yes. Advanced semantic probe configurations can detect 'Intent Collision'—when two different tools have such similar descriptions that an AI agent might arbitrarily pick the wrong one." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "How do self-healing tools work?", a: "When an AI makes a mistake, the tool returns a `toolError()` with a specific error code, an explanation, and a suggested recovery action. The AI reads this structured error and automatically retries with the correct parameters, without human intervention." },
      { q: "What makes structured error recovery better than string errors?", a: "Plain string errors ('Invalid input') give the AI no guidance, leading to random guessing and hallucination. Structured errors tell the AI exactly what went wrong and what action to call next, creating a deterministic recovery loop." },
      { q: "Do all LLMs natively support self-healing loops?", a: "The major LLMs (Claude 3.5, GPT-4o) do. The MCP client executes the tool, receives the text error response containing the 'Try again' semantic instructions, and simply passes that back into the LLM context, which triggers the intrinsic reasoning to auto-correct." },
      { q: "Can self-healing prevent prompt injection payloads?", a: "Yes. If an AI agent attempts to pass SQL syntax through an MCP text field, a Zod regex validator can catch the malicious input, trigger a `toolError`, and explicitly inject a `_systemRule` commanding the AI to stop generating hostile payloads." },
      { q: "How do I test a self-healing error flow locally?", a: "You can write a unit test block using `VurbTester`. You intentionally feed it bad arguments, extract the resulting `toolError` payload, and use an automated asserter to verify that the `.suggestedArgs` properly reflect the expected safe inputs." },

      { q: "Do I need to install the CLI globally?", a: "No. The highly recommended approach is using `npx Vurb.ts-cli` or accessing the `fusion` binary perfectly injected into your project's local `node_modules/.bin` pathway." },
      { q: "Can I integrate the CLI into my CI/CD pipeline?", a: "Yes. Commands like `fusion check` return standard Unix exit codes. Throwing an `exit 1` when a lockfile drifts means pipelines in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins will natively halt the build." },
      { q: "Does the CLI format output for machine parsing?", a: "The `fusion diff` and `fusion tokens` commands both support `--format json`. This allows you to pipe the command outputs dynamically into custom security validation scripts, alerting systems, or chat-ops bots." },
      { q: "Where does the CLI read configuration from?", a: "The CLI automatically looks for the `vurb.config.js` or `vurb.config.ts` file in your directory root. This config informs the CLI about custom path aliases, ignored tools, and active connector plugins." },

Use Zod schemas in `schemas.input` to validate payloads, and `schemas.presenter` to shape the output. The presenter automatically strips sensitive database columns before sending data to the AI agent." },
      { q: "Should CRUD tools use destructive annotations?", a: "Yes. Any action that modifies data (create, update, delete) should map to `destructive: true` (or `idempotent: true` for overwrite-only updates) so the MCP client can warn the user before execution. In Vurb.ts, this is enforced automatically if you map HTTP verbs or use strict grouping conventions." },
      { q: "How do I implement pagination for the read action?", a: "Require `take` and `skip` parameters in your input Zod schema, passing them directly to your ORM. Always combine this with a Context Tree-Shaking ceiling (like `.agentLimit(100)`) to prevent the AI from requesting millions of rows." },
      { q: "How do I handle unique constraint errors during create?", a: "Catch the database exception and return a structured `toolError('Record already exists').withSuggestedArgs({ id: 'new-id' })`. This guides the LLM to either retry with a new ID or switch to the `update` action." },
      { q: "Do CRUD boundaries respect Context Tree-Shaking?", a: "Yes. Exposing full tables can bloat the LLM token budget. The best practice is for the read action to expose a compressed TOON string, while the find-by-id action returns the full JSON object." },

The unified perception package is returned." },
      { q: "When does input validation occur?", a: "Validation happens immediately after routing, before any middleware or handler logic executes. If the AI provides a string instead of an integer, the framework immediately intercepts it and returns an auto-generated `toolError` instructing the AI to correct the type." },
      { q: "Can middleware modify the request arguments?", a: "No. Currently, payloads are strictly checked against the static Zod inputs. Middleware operates on the `Context` object (e.g., extracting headers and assigning user roles) instead of mutating the raw arguments." },
      { q: "In what order do Presenters execute?", a: "Presenters execute sequentially after the handler completes successfully. The returned handler data flows into the `.present()` pipeline, which applies PII stripping, schema matching, TOON conversions, and finally rule injection." },
      { q: "What happens if an unhandled exception is thrown in the handler?", a: "Vurb.ts catches it automatically. It prevents the Node process from dying, logs the error via the Observability subsystem, and returns a sanitized `500 Internal Error` MCP payload avoiding stack-trace leaks." },

      { q: "Does Vurb.ts support Hot Module Reload (HMR)?", a: "Yes. Use `npx Vurb.ts dev` to start your server. It wraps the Node process and provides native HMR for tools, presenters, and schemas. When you save a file, the MCP server updates handlers instantly without terminating the stdio or SSE connection, meaning your AI agent never loses context." },
      { q: "Do I need to restart my AI client (e.g., Cursor) when I add a new tool?", a: "Sometimes. HMR perfectly hot-reloads the implementation logic. However, if you add an entirely new tool name, some LLM clients cache the initial capabilities list. In that case, you may need to click 'Refresh' in your client UI." },
      { q: "Can I use HMR with SSE endpoints?", a: "Yes. The HMR engine replaces module graphs dynamically beneath the active SSE transport layer. Your active connections remain intact while the background routing logic swaps out." },
      { q: "Is HMR safe for production servers?", a: "No. The `Vurb.ts dev` command injects a lot of DOM and file-watching overhead. In production, you must always run the compiled output using `node dist/server.js` or via a lightweight `tsx` runner for maximum stability and speed." },
      { q: "What happens if I write a syntax error during HMR?", a: "The server catches the compilation error, logs it to your console, and temporarily halts updates. Your active server session remains alive running the previous valid code state until you fix the typo." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "What is a Presenter in the MVA architecture?", a: "In the Model-View-Agent (MVA) pattern, the Presenter acts as the View for AI clients. It takes raw Model data, validates it against a Zod output schema, strips sensitive fields, and attaches Agentic Affordances, Cognitive Guardrails, and Context-Aware System Rules before returning the structured Perception Package." },
      { q: "Why shouldn't I return raw database objects to the AI agent?", a: "Returning raw data is an anti-pattern that causes massive token waste and critical security risks (e.g., leaking password hashes or internal foreign keys). Presenters use Zod .strict() schemas and .present() to guarantee that only the explicitly authorized, normalized data shape reaches the LLM." },
      { q: "How do Presenters improve AI agent accuracy?", a: "Presenters inject contextual system rules ('agentic HATEOAS') directly into the data response. Instead of the AI guessing how to interpret a status flag, the Presenter appends a rule explaining the status meaning and explicitly suggesting the exact tools the AI should use next to progress." },
      { q: "Can a Presenter return multiple items?", a: "Yes. Presenters support both single object resolution via .present(data) and array resolution via .presentMany(dataArray). Both methods apply the same schema validation, filter undeclared fields, and merge system rules consistently for the entire payload." },
      { q: "Do Presenters handle UI elements for Claude Desktop?", a: "Yes. Presenters can inject UI blocks using .withUIBlock(). For example, when returning an image or a complex dashboard, the Presenter can append a markdown or custom UI block that the MCP client (like Claude Desktop or Cursor) renders visually to the user alongside the JSON data." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "How do I compose nested Presenters in Vurb.ts?", a: "You use the Presenter.embed() or Presenter.embedMany() methods. If a Project model has an array of nested sprint objects, you map them using SprintPresenter.embedMany(project.sprints). This automatically validates nested schemas and recursively merges all descendant system rules." },
      { q: "Why use embed() instead of calling .present() manually inside another Presenter?", a: "Calling .embed() is critical because it preserves the Context-Tree Shaking pipeline. It extracts the system rules, UI blocks, and affordances from the child objects and bubbles them up to the parent response. Manual casting would lose those crucial AI agent instructions." },
      { q: "Does Presenter composition increase LLM latency?", a: "No. Presenter composition is structurally synchronous and highly optimized. Zod schema validation is the only overhead, ensuring your structured JSON response is compliant. It actually decreases pure LLM execution time because the agent receives smaller, strictly filtered data payloads." },
      { q: "Can child Presenters add global system rules to the parent response?", a: "Yes. When you embed a child Presenter, its .withSystemRule() outputs are bubbled up and deduplicated. If 10 nested tasks all require the same 'How to transition a task' rule, it only appears once in the final perception package." },
      { q: "Is deeply nested Presenter composition supported?", a: "Yes. You can nest Presenters infinitely (e.g., Organization -> Project -> Sprint -> Task -> Comment).

      { q: "Can I bypass Presenters and build custom MCP responses?", a: "Yes. While Presenters are the best practice for Domain Entities (like Users or Projects), you can use the fluent ResponseBuilder for ad-hoc tool results. Just use `return respond().withData(val).build();` from within your action handler." },
      { q: "How do I add system rules to a custom response?", a: "Chain the .withSystemRule() method onto your ResponseBuilder. Instead of binding to a static definition, you inject instructions dynamically: `respond().withData(stats).withSystemRule('The conversion rate dropped, check analytics').build()`." },
      { q: "How do I return raw text instead of JSON?", a: "If an agent explicitly needs a raw text dump to parse manually, use `respond().withText(string).build()`. Unlike .withData(obj) which formats as JSON, this returns the raw string content as an MCP Text Content block." },
      { q: "Can a custom response include UI blocks for Claude Desktop?", a: "Yes. Use `respond().withUIBlock(component)` to inject custom UI payload elements, like a charting payload or custom markdown block. Clients that support richer UI rendering will present it to the user without confusing the AI's data payload." },
      { q: "Is ResponseBuilder type-safe?", a: "Yes. The ResponseBuilder provides a fully strictly typed fluent API. However, unlike Presenters, it does not enforce an egress Zod schema on your raw arbitrary data, so you must be careful not to leak sensitive attributes." },

      { q: "Can system rules be aware of the user's role?", a: "Yes. The context object provides full access to the request's authentication state. You can conditionally append rules for admins only using `ctx.auth.role === 'admin'`. The AI agent will only learn about admin capabilities if the request was made by an administrative user." },
      { q: "Do context-aware rules affect token usage?", a: "They drastically reduce token usage. Because rules are evaluated lazily per-row, instructions are only injected when their exact failure condition or context trigger exists in the data. The prompt remains perfectly concise." },
      { q: "Can I use multiple context-aware rules in one Presenter?", a: "Absolutely. You can chain as many `.withSystemRule()` calls as necessary. Each rule can have independent trigger logic. Vurb.ts will evaluate all of them, strip out nulls, deduplicate exact matches, and concatenate the active rules for the agent." },
      { q: "How does context-aware rule resolution handle arrays?", a: "When calling .presentMany(), the Presenter will evaluate the conditional rules against EVERY item in the array.

      { q: "What is Context Tree-Shaking in Vurb.ts?", a: "Context Tree-Shaking is an AI optimization engine that automatically drops null, undefined, or duplicated system rules and affordances from the Presenter pipeline before sending the payload. It ensures zero LLM prompt pollution." },
      { q: "How does tree-shaking reduce hallucination?", a: "If an AI receives rules for error conditions when no errors exist, it may hallucinate context and try to fix a non-existent problem. Context Tree-Shaking removes irrelevant instructions based on current data state, maintaining absolute focus." },
      { q: "Does tree-shaking happen at compile time or run time?", a: "It happens purely at runtime. The rules are evaluated dynamically against the actual row data and runtime user context (like RBAC tokens). The tree-shaker then prunes the generated ruleset per-request." },
      { q: "Is context tree-shaking applied to nested Presenters automatically?", a: "Yes. Any rules bubbled up from child Presenters via .embed() or .embedMany() are subject to the same global deduplication and null-pruning passes on the parent Presenter level. There is absolute certainty the output is minified." },
      { q: "Do I need to enable tree-shaking manually?", a: "No. Context Tree-Shaking is a core architectural pillar of Vurb.ts and is enabled by default on all Presenters and ResponseBuilders. You literally just write declarative rules; the framework optimizes the token payload." },

      { q: "How does Select Reflection work?", a: "Select Reflection is the design pattern of deriving AI instructions from the exact fields present in the response database record. If the `status` is 'failed', the Presenter reflects that by injecting a specific system rule on how to debug failures." },
      { q: "Why is Select Reflection better than global prompts?", a: "Global prompts apply equally to all entities, causing agents to execute irrelevant instructions. Select Reflection ensures the LLM only receives guidance that directly pertains to the specific entity it just acted upon." },
      { q: "Can Select Reflection trigger other tools?", a: "Yes. In the rule resolution, you can explicitly mention other MCP tools. For example, if a user's subscription record reflects an 'overdue' state, the Presenter rule can say 'To fix this, call billing.charge with the outstanding amount.'" },
      { q: "Does Select Reflection support complex business logic?", a: "Absolutely. Because Presenters run standard TypeScript, you can query external states, calculate derived fields, or check RBAC permissions to dynamically resolve whether a rule should be reflected into the AI agent's perception." },

      { q: "How do I suggest the next action to the AI agent?", a: "Use Agentic Affordances via `.suggestActions(['projects.update', 'projects.delete'])` on the Presenter or ResponseBuilder. This inserts an actionable hint into the response, drastically reducing hallucinations when the AI tries to figure out what to do next." },
      { q: "What is an Agentic Affordance?", a: "An affordance is a hint returned in the payload that tells the AI agent what capabilities are available relative to the data it just queried. It essentially creates HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State) but engineered specifically for autonomous LLMs." },
      { q: "Do Agentic Affordances prevent the AI from using other tools?", a: "No. Affordances act as strong suggestions, not hard restrictions. The AI agent fundamentally still controls its action loop, but suggesting the correct tool skips the 'search-and-discovery' phase, saving tokens and improving speed." },
      { q: "Can I provide dynamic affordances based on role?", a: "Yes. Using the Presenter context, you can conditionally serve `.suggestActions()`: give standard users `['read', 'comment']`, but give admins `['read', 'comment', 'delete', 'ban_user']`, preventing the AI from even attempting to call unauthorized actions." },
      { q: "Where do affordances appear in the MCP response?", a: "Vurb.ts automatically formats `.suggestActions()` into a strict array within the `_suggestedActions` key of the JSON payload.

      { q: "Do cognitive guardrails save money?", a: "Yes. Returning 1,000 unpaginated rows could consume 300,000 tokens for a single read operation. Implementing limits truncates this to a safe token threshold, directly slashing API costs for LLM consumption." },
      { q: "What happens when a list is truncated by a guardrail?", a: "The framework intercepts the Array, truncates the extra items, and appends a `_cognitiveGuardrails` key to the payload. This key clearly informs the LLM that '150 items were omitted' so the agent knows its data view is partial." },
      { q: "Can the AI agent fix a truncated response?", a: "Yes, because Cognitive Guardrails proactively instruct the AI how to narrow its query. The guardrail typically suggests using the search or filter parameters on the tool, effectively teaching the AI how to paginate." },
      { q: "Should I handle pagination in the database or via guardrails?", a: "Both.

      { q: "Do tool groups affect middleware execution?", a: "Yes. Middleware is scoped hierarchically. If you attach an auth middleware to the `aws` group, every single action within `aws.ec2` or `aws.s3` automatically inherits that middleware. It's the most secure way to enforce RBAC." },
      { q: "Is there a limit to how deeply I can nest groups?", a: "No hard limit, but practically, 2-3 levels deep (e.g., `provider.service.action`) is recommended. Extremely long tool names can consume unnecessary tokens in the AI's prompt when the tool definitions are exposed." },
      { q: "Does hierarchical grouping help with Context Tree-Shaking?", a: "Yes. By clustering related actions, the MCP client can be configured to selectively expose only specific groups to the LLM based on user intent, vastly reducing the initial tool listing overhead." },

      { q: "How does functional grouping improve code maintainability?", a: "It limits file sizes and ensures Domain-Driven Design (DDD). Instead of a monolithic router with 200 actions, you have isolated, testable modules where actions, schemas, and domain-specific middleware live together." },

      { q: "Does cancellation work on server-sent events (SSEServerTransport)?", a: "Yes. When the client closes the HTTP connection during SSE execution, the adapter detects the socket closure and immediately fires the `AbortSignal` inside your active handler." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "How do I secure my MCP tools with Authentication?", a: "You define a global `.withGlobalMiddleware()` or group-specific `.withMiddleware()` that intercepts the request, reads custom headers or payload metadata, verifies the identity (e.g., JWT validation), and hydrates `ctx.user`." },
      { q: "Can middleware reject unauthorized requests?", a: "Yes. If the user lacks permissions, your middleware can return a `toolError('Unauthorized').withCode('FORBIDDEN')`. This immediately short-circuits the request pipeline, bypassing the action handler completely and returning the error to the LLM." },
      { q: "How do I type my custom authentication context?", a: "Vurb.ts uses a robust generic type system. When defining your toolbuilder, you pass a custom `Context` interface. The Auth middleware's job is mapping the base transport context into a strictly typed `Context` with the `user` property guaranteed." },
      { q: "Should the AI agent pass the auth token as an argument?", a: "No. Never expose tokens into the AI's prompt space. Authentication should happen transparently at the transport layer (e.g., HTTP headers via the connector) so the LLM remains completely oblivious to the secure lifecycle." },
      { q: "Does middleware affect Context Tree-Shaking?", a: "Indirectly. Middleware establishes the secure runtime `ctx` (like user roles). Presenters then evaluate that exact context to conditionally inject system rules. If RBAC middleware assigns a 'guest' role, the Presenter will automatically strip any 'admin' instructions." },

      { q: "What is an MCP Prompt?", a: "An MCP Prompt is a registered template that an AI client can query to bootstrap its context window. It usually contains system instructions, base rules, and foundational context data to kickstart a specialized generative workflow." },
      { q: "How do I define a prompt in Vurb.ts?", a: "Use the `PromptBuilder` fluent API (`prompt('name')`). You can chain `.describe()`, define structured arguments with `.withArgs()`, and construct the resulting payload inside the `.withHandler()` using standard MCP message blocks." },
      { q: "Can prompts take dynamic arguments?", a: "Yes. By using Zod schemas in `.withArgs()`, the prompt requires arguments (like `projectId`). The client UI can display form fields to the user, and the handler uses those strictly typed arguments to query the DB and build context." },
      { q: "Can I use Presenters inside a Prompt handler?", a: "Absolutely! The best practice is to load data from standard repositories and route it through a Presenter to strip PII and apply rules, then embed that structured Presenter output directly into the prompt's `respond().withText()` or resource blocks." },
      { q: "How do prompts differ from standard MCP tools?", a: "Tools are actions the AI chooses to execute dynamically during a conversation. Prompts are predefined contexts executed *before* or *at the start* of a conversation by the human user to initialize the agent's behavior." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "What are Runtime Guards in Vurb.ts?", a: "Runtime Guards are built-in protection patterns (like the Bulkhead pattern) that prevent AI agents from destabilizing your server. They manage concurrency limits, timeout bounds, and maximum execution rates at the individual tool level." },
      { q: "How do I limit concurrency for an expensive tool?", a: "You can apply a concurrency guard via middleware. If an AI agent tries to execute 50 parallel instances of an expensive PDF scraping tool, the middleware will accept the first N requests and immediately fail the rest with a clear error instruction for the AI to 'slow down'." },
      { q: "What is an Egress payload limiter?", a: "Payload limits protect the memory of both the MCP server and the AI client. A runtime guard checks the response byte size before transmission. If the tool generates a 50MB log file, the guard intercepts it, aborts transmission, and sends an error commanding the AI to use pagination." },
      { q: "Can runtime guards protect against 'Thundering Herd' scenarios?", a: "Yes. In multi-agent environments where swarm agents might dogpile a single resource (like a specific database query), concurrency guards act as a bulkhead, shedding load predictably so the server stays healthy." },
      { q: "Are runtime guards configurable per environment?", a: "Absolutely. You can inject environment variables into your runtime guards. This allows you to set aggressive concurrency limits in production while relaxing them for local `Vurb.ts dev` testing." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "What is a Self-Healing Context?", a: "It is an engineering pattern where, instead of just failing, an MCP tool analyzes the error and returns a highly structured response instructing the AI exactly how to recover. The LLM reads this and silently retries with the correct parameters." },
      { q: "Why is self-healing better than regular error throwing?", a: "Standard errors break the agent's chain of thought, forcing it to guess the root cause. A self-healing context acts as a deterministic guide-rail, turning runtime failures into successful recovery loops without human intervention." },
      { q: "How do I implement suggested arguments for recovery?", a: "When returning a `toolError`, use `.withSuggestedArgs({ key: 'correctValue' })`. Vurb.ts formats this so the AI explicitly sees the parameter it must change. It drastically improves the speed at which models like Claude fix their own API calls." },
      { q: "Can I suggest different tools for error recovery?", a: "Yes. Combined with Agentic Affordances, your error response can use `.suggestActions(['auth.login'])`. If a tool fails due to missing credentials, the AI is immediately directed to execute the login tool before retrying the original action." },
      { q: "How do I prevent infinite loops in self-healing tools?", a: "MCP clients keep a token budget and context window limit. However, best practice is to attach a failure count to the session context or restrict the `toolError` loop to simply returning 'Final Failure: Do not retry' after a designated threshold." },

    faqs: [
      { q: "What is TOON Encoding?", a: "TOON stands for Token-Oriented Object Notation. It's an Vurb.ts innovation that serializes flat JSON arrays into a heavily compressed, pipe-delimited scalar format. It's designed specifically to pack densely into the LLM context window." },
      { q: "How much token savings does TOON provide?", a: "Typically 30% to 50% compared to standard JSON arrays. By eliminating thousands of repetitive JSON keys, quotes, and brackets, the sheer number of tokens passed to the LLM is drastically reduced, shrinking latency and costs." },
      { q: "Can LLMs successfully parse TOON formats?", a: "Yes. State-of-the-art models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o are native experts at parsing tabular, pipe-delimited data. Vurb.ts automatically injects a tiny decoder key into the system rules so the AI understands exactly which column is which." },
      { q: "How do I enable TOON encoding in a Presenter?", a: "You simply call `.useToonEncoding()` on your Presenter configuration. When returning arrays of data, Vurb.ts automatically intercepts the outbound JSON, converts it to TOON scalars, and seamlessly injects the map schema for the agent." },
      { q: "Is TOON suitable for heavily nested data?", a: "No. TOON is heavily optimized for flat arrays (like a vast list of server logs or users). For deeply nested models, standard JSON representation remains the best practice. You should apply Context Tree-Shaking to nested objects instead." },

      { q: "What should I do with the generated lockfile?", a: "You must commit `vurb.lock.json` to your version control system (e.g., Git). This ensures that every member of the team and your CI/CD pipelines are validating against the exact same intended tool specifications." },
      { q: "Does the lockfile track Presenter schemas?", a: "Yes. The capability lockfile natively serializes the exact egress schemas declared in your MVA Presenters. If a developer accidentally exposes an internal database ID in a Presenter, the lockfile diff will expose it instantly." },
      { q: "Can a lockfile detect undocumented destructive tools?", a: "Absolutely. When `npx Vurb.ts lock` runs, it enforces that any action mutating state must be explicitly annotated. The lockfile freezes these `destructive: true` flags, preventing silent authorization escalation later." },

      { q: "What formats can the contract diff output?", a: "By default, `npx Vurb.ts diff` provides a color-coded terminal output. However, you can use `--format markdown` to generate a GitHub PR comment, or `--format json` to programmatically pipe the diff into automated security evaluation tools." },
      { q: "Can contract diffing detect removed input parameters?", a: "Yes. The diffing engine runs a deep structural equality check on the Zod AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). If an optional parameter is made required, or a required parameter is deleted entirely, it is explicitly flagged as a breaking change." },
      { q: "How does contract diffing improve AI agent safety?", a: "It guarantees zero undocumented capability drift. A developer cannot silently add a `delete_user` tool to an existing billing namespace without the contract diff explicitly broadcasting the new `destructive` capability to the Pull Request reviewers." },
      { q: "Is contract diffing compatible with GitHub Actions?", a: "Yes. Vurb.ts provides native recipes for executing the diff command inside GitHub Actions, automatically appending the resulting markdown table as a persistent comment on the active PR so security teams have full oversight." },

      { q: "What metrics are included in a blast radius report?", a: "The CLI outputs a Risk Score, the total count of impacted end-user actions, the list of affected Agentic Affordances, and flags any potential disruptions to interconnected Context-Aware System Rules." },
      { q: "Can the CLI block high-risk deployments?", a: "Yes. You can configure `npx Vurb.ts analyze --fail-threshold 80`. If a developer modifies a global auth middleware that impacts every single tool, the blast radius score will exceed 80 and exit with code 1, halting the CI pipeline." },
      { q: "Does blast radius analysis execute my code?", a: "No. It uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) static analysis and TypeScript introspection to evaluate the capability map safely. It requires zero active LLM tokens and does not execute any live database logic or action handlers." },

This built-in governance utility parses your tools' Zod schemas, descriptions, and TOON annotations to provide an estimated prompt overhead in tokens using standard BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding) models." },
      { q: "Can I identify the most expensive tools in my server?", a: "Yes. The `npx Vurb.ts tokens` command automatically ranks your tools from most expensive to least expensive based on string density, nested schema depth, and Presenter configuration, letting you pinpoint token hogs immediately." },
      { q: "What is the fastest way to shrink my token footprint?", a: "Rewrite your conversational English tool descriptions into TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) shorthand via `.describeToon()`, and enforce Context Tree-Shaking to prevent global system rules from unnecessarily inflating individual AI contexts." },
      { q: "Does token economics account for runtime array sizes?", a: "Yes. The token command evaluates any `.agentLimit(N)` constraints on your Presenters. If you cap a users array at 50, the analyzer reliably calculates the absolute maximum token payload boundary for that specific tool." },
      { q: "Can I enforce a maximum token budget per tool?", a: "Yes. Using the CLI, you can set a global or per-tool ceiling (e.g., `--max-tokens 500`). If a developer attempts to merge a massive, unoptimized Zod schema that exceeds this limit, the CI pipeline will reject the change." },

If a malicious script running on your CI/CD server modifies the compiled JavaScript to silently expose a `delete_database` tool, the production server will reject the startup sequence because the cryptographic signature will not match the compiled AST." },
      { q: "How does the Vurb.ts server verify the signature at runtime?", a: "During the bootstrap phase, you initialize the `ToolRegistry` with `.requireAttestation(publicKey)`. The framework will verify the `.sig` file against the live memory capabilities graph before opening the SSE or stdio transports." },
      { q: "Does attestation work with keyless signing infrastructure like Sigstore?", a: "Yes. The attestation hooks in Vurb.ts are fully pluggable.

Vurb.ts's router will automatically extract and hydrate this into the active context." },
      { q: "Can I create custom nested spans inside my tool handler?", a: "Absolutely.

      { q: "Does cacheSignal reduce LLM costs?", a: "Dramatically. By preventing the AI from redundantly querying the same status endpoint in a frantic loop (e.g., 'Is the job done yet?'), you save both server database load and the massive LLM token cost associated with the response payload." },
      { q: "How do I handle ETag-based caching?", a: "You can return an `_etag` inside your custom ResponseBuilder payload. In the next request, the AI client passes the ETag back via arguments, and your handler can return a lightweight `304 Not Modified` equivalent if the data hasn't changed." },

(4) Context window overflow — unbounded response sizes crash the agent. (5) Stale data after mutations — agent acts on outdated cached data. (6) Blind retry loops — agent retries with the same bad parameters. (7) Data leaking to the LLM — sensitive fields like password hashes reach the context.

    faqs: [
      { q: 'How do I implement the Saga Pattern in Vurb.ts?', a: 'Vurb.ts implements the Saga Pattern without any new abstraction. Compose multi-step operations into a single f.mutation() tool. Each step executes sequentially inside the handler. If a step fails, the catch block compensates all previous steps in reverse order and returns a self-healing f.error() with recovery instructions. The agent sees one atomic tool — not the individual steps.' },
      { q: 'Why should I compose multi-step workflows into a single MCP tool?', a: 'Because the MCP protocol has no concept of a transaction spanning multiple tool calls. If you expose 3 separate tools (users.create, billing.charge, email.send), the agent calls them independently. If step 3 fails, steps 1 and 2 have already executed — leaving corrupted state. A single tool with internal compensation ensures atomicity at the server level, where the developer controls ordering and rollback.' },
      { q: 'What is the check-then-act pattern for transactional MCP tools?', a: 'Check-then-act validates all preconditions before making any changes. Place all business rule checks (does the record exist? is the status correct? is it already processed?) before the first mutation. If every validation happens before the first database write, you never need compensation for validation errors — which are the most common failure mode with AI agents.' },
      { q: 'How do I make MCP tool operations idempotent?', a: 'Design the handler to detect previous execution and return success without re-executing. Before performing the operation, check the current status: if (order.status === "fulfilled") return { status: "fulfilled", note: "Already fulfilled" }. Mark the tool with .idempotent() to signal to the LLM that retries are safe. The handler enforces idempotency; the annotation informs the client.' },
      { q: 'How does Vurb.ts prevent concurrent execution of transactional workflows?', a: 'Three complementary mechanisms: (1) .destructive() activates the MutationSerializer, which serializes concurrent calls to the same tool in FIFO order. (2) .concurrency({ maxActive: 3, maxQueue: 10 }) limits simultaneous executions with a semaphore and backpressure queue. (3) .invalidates("users.*", "billing.*") signals stale data after success, preventing the agent from acting on outdated information.' },

Each catch block should: (1) call the compensation action for each successfully completed step (e.g., refund the charge, delete the user), (2) return f.error() with a specific error code for the failure point, (3) include .suggest() with actionable recovery instructions, and (4) optionally add .retryAfter(seconds) to tell the agent when to retry.' },

    faqs: [
      { q: 'What is the Sandbox Engine in Vurb.ts?', a: 'The Sandbox Engine lets an LLM send JavaScript logic as a string to your MCP server. The framework executes that code inside a sealed V8 isolate (via isolated-vm) with zero access to process, require, fs, net, or eval. Data stays on the server — only the computed result crosses the boundary. This is Computation Delegation: serverless ultra-secure execution inside the client\'s own server.' },
      { q: 'How does the Sandbox Engine prevent security attacks?', a: 'The V8 Context is created completely empty — no globalThis properties, no setTimeout, no Proxy, no Function constructor. Even if the LLM sends malicious code attempting prototype pollution, constructor escapes, or import() calls, the V8 engine itself blocks execution because those APIs physically do not exist inside the isolate.' },
      { q: 'What resource limits does the Sandbox Engine enforce?', a: 'Three configurable limits: timeout (default 5000ms) kills scripts that run too long, memoryLimit (default 128MB) caps V8 heap allocation, and maxOutputBytes (default 1MB) prevents oversized results from flooding the response. All limits are enforced at the V8 engine level — not in JavaScript — making them impossible to bypass.' },
      { q: 'How does the Sandbox Engine prevent memory leaks?', a: 'Every ExternalCopy, Script, and Context created during execution is released in a mandatory try/finally block. The copyInto({ release: true }) pattern auto-releases the C++ pointer when data enters the isolate. If the isolate dies (OOM or abort), the engine automatically recreates it on the next call. This prevents the most dangerous class of Node.js memory leak: C++ pointers outside the GC.' },
      { q: 'What is the Connection Watchdog in Vurb.ts?', a: 'The Connection Watchdog is a kill-switch that prevents zombie sandbox computations. When a user closes their MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop) mid-request, the TCP connection dies but Node.js doesn\'t know. The sandbox would keep running until timeout. The Connection Watchdog solves this: it wires the MCP SDK\'s AbortSignal to isolate.dispose(), killing V8 C++ threads instantly when client disconnect is detected. The engine auto-recovers on the next call.' },
      { q: 'How does the AbortSignal integration work in the Sandbox Engine?', a: 'The execute() method accepts an optional { signal: AbortSignal } parameter. Before V8 allocation, a pre-flight check skips execution if the signal is already aborted. During execution, an abort listener calls isolate.dispose() to kill the V8 threads immediately. The error is classified as ABORTED (not MEMORY), and the listener is cleaned up in a finally block to prevent memory leaks.' },
      { q: 'What is SandboxGuard in Vurb.ts?', a: 'SandboxGuard is a fail-fast syntax checker that runs BEFORE the V8 isolate. It rejects non-function expressions, flags suspicious patterns (require, import, process), and validates basic structure. This is a speed optimization — catching obvious errors before allocating V8 resources — not a security boundary. The empty V8 Context is the real security boundary.' },
      { q: 'How do I enable sandboxing in the Fluent API?', a: 'Call .sandboxed() on any FluentToolBuilder: f.query("analytics.compute").sandboxed({ timeout: 3000 }).handle(...).

    faqs: [
      { q: 'What is the FSM State Gate in Vurb.ts?', a: 'The FSM State Gate is a temporal anti-hallucination engine that physically removes tools from the MCP tools/list response based on the current state of a finite state machine. If the workflow state is "empty", a tool like "cart.pay" literally does not exist in the response — the LLM cannot call it. When the state advances (e.g., item added), the framework emits notifications/tools/list_changed and the tool appears.' },
      { q: 'How does the FSM State Gate prevent LLM hallucination?', a: 'LLMs are chaotic — even with HATEOAS suggestActions hints, a model can ignore suggestions and call tools out of order. Zod validates format, suggestActions suggests order, but the FSM State Gate enforces order by physically removing unavailable tools from the protocol response. The LLM cannot hallucinate calling a tool that does not exist in its tool list.' },
      { q: 'How does .bindState() work in Vurb.ts?', a: 'The .bindState() method on FluentToolBuilder associates a tool with specific FSM states and an optional transition event. For example, .bindState("has_items", "CHECKOUT") means the tool is only visible when the FSM is in the "has_items" state, and upon successful execution, the FSM receives the "CHECKOUT" event to advance.' },
      { q: 'Does the FSM State Gate work in serverless environments?', a: 'Yes. The FSM supports external state persistence via fsmStore — an interface with load(sessionId) and save(sessionId, snapshot) methods. On platforms like Vercel or Cloudflare Workers, you provide a Redis, KV, or Durable Objects-backed store. The framework automatically restores state before processing and persists it after transitions.' },
      { q: 'What happens if a tool execution fails with the FSM State Gate?', a: 'FSM transitions only fire on successful execution (!result.isError). If the tool handler returns an error, the state remains unchanged — the LLM can retry the same tool or choose a different strategy within the same state. This prevents invalid state advancement on failures.' },
      { q: 'Does the FSM State Gate conflict with suggestActions (HATEOAS)?', a: 'No. They are complementary. suggestActions is a soft guidance layer — hints that the LLM can ignore. The FSM State Gate is a hard constraint — tools physically disappear. Use both together for maximum reliability: the gate controls visibility, suggestActions recommends the best next tool within the visible set.' },
      { q: 'Is XState required to use the FSM State Gate?', a: 'No. XState (v5+) is an optional peer dependency. Without it, the FSM uses a built-in manual fallback engine that supports the same FsmConfig format. The manual engine is sufficient for simple linear workflows.
