# MVA Architecture

Every software architecture in history assumes a human at the end of the pipeline. MVC renders HTML for browsers. MVVM binds state to visual components. REST exposes resources for mobile apps. All of them rely on a consumer that can **interpret ambiguity**, **navigate inconsistency**, and **apply domain knowledge** that the interface never provided.

AI agents can do none of this. When an agent receives `{ "amount_cents": 45000 }`, it does not *know* it's cents. It does not *know* to divide by 100. It does not *know* that the next action is `billing.pay`. It guesses — and when it guesses wrong, it hallucinates.

**MVA solves this by replacing the human-centric View with the Presenter** — a deterministic perception layer that tells the agent exactly what the data means, how to display it, and what to do next.

## The Three Layers

| Layer | Role | Implemented As |
|---|---|---|
| **Model** | Defines the shape and constraints of domain data. Acts as a security boundary when using `.strict()` — only declared fields pass through. | `z.object({ ... }).strict()` |
| **View (Presenter)** | Transforms raw data into a **Structured Perception Package** — data + rules + UI blocks + affordances + guardrails. Domain-level, not tool-level. | `definePresenter()` / `createPresenter()` |
| **Agent** | The autonomous consumer. Receives the perception package and acts deterministically based on the structured context it was given. | Any MCP-compatible LLM (Claude, GPT, Gemini series, or open-weight models) |

## The Core Thesis

**An AI agent should never have to guess.**

Every piece of data should arrive with:
1. **Validation** — a schema that rejects what doesn't belong
2. **Interpretation rules** — domain knowledge that removes ambiguity
3. **Visual representation** — server-rendered charts and diagrams
4. **Action guidance** — explicit next steps based on data state
5. **Cognitive limits** — bounded results with filter guidance

When all five are present, the agent perceives the domain consistently. Hallucination risk is reduced at the architecture level, not patched at the prompt level.

## Quick Reference: MVA in Code

```typescript
import { createPresenter, ui, defineTool } from '@vinkius-core/mcp-fusion';
import { z } from 'zod';

// ── MODEL: Security boundary via Zod schema ──
const invoiceSchema = z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    amount_cents: z.number(),
    status: z.enum(['paid', 'pending', 'overdue']),
    // internal_margin, password_hash → rejected by .strict()
}).strict();  // explicit security boundary

// ── VIEW: The Presenter — agent-centric perception layer ──
const InvoicePresenter = createPresenter('Invoice')
    .schema(invoiceSchema)                                // Model
    .systemRules([                                        // Interpretation
        'CRITICAL: amount_cents is in CENTS. Divide by 100.',
    ])
    .uiBlocks((inv) => [                                  // Visualization
        ui.echarts({ series: [{ type: 'gauge', data: [{ value: inv.amount_cents / 100 }] }] }),
    ])
    .agentLimit(50, (omitted) =>                          // Guardrail
        ui.summary(`⚠️ 50 shown, ${omitted} hidden. Use filters.`)
    )
    .suggestActions((inv) =>                               // Affordance
        inv.status === 'pending'
            ? [{ tool: 'billing.pay', reason: 'Process payment' }]
            : []
    );

// ── AGENT: Receives a Structured Perception Package ──
const billing = defineTool<AppContext>('billing', {
    actions: {
        get_invoice: {
            returns: InvoicePresenter,  // ← One line. Zero boilerplate.
            params: { id: 'string' },
            handler: async (ctx, args) => ctx.db.invoices.findUnique(args.id),
        },
    },
});
```

The handler returns **raw data**. The Presenter intercepts it in the execution pipeline, validates through Zod, strips undeclared fields, attaches domain rules, renders charts, applies truncation, and suggests next actions — all automatically. The agent never sees raw JSON. It sees a **structured perception package**.
